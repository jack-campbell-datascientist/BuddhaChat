Hello,
My name is Jack.


I am working on creating an AI chatbot who has been trained on buddhist sutras for a couple of reasons.

From most important to least important, these reasons are:
1. I wanted to create a simple AI chatbot to learn about how AI works.
2. I am interested in the buddhist sutras, and am curious about how easy it is to synthesize and re-apply some of the wisdom found within (it's hard, but life is suffering, right? What are ya gonna do?).
3. I am increasingly weary of being a mechanic. I am not only a large, diesel soaked oaf with a wrench. I am also a smart computer man who wears glasses (to prove conclusively that I am smart, and also secondarily for my vision because I NEED them). I need a way to show this to empoloyers because SO FAR THEY DO NOT BELIEVE ME AND I DO NOT KNOW WHY.  
4. Although I understand the basics of each of the non-A-building-components of this project (web scraping, data cleaning, building a website, etc.), I haven't really done a start to finish project where I do ALL OF THEM together, and I thought I'd learn a good amount about the development process/just learn in general, and I'm a straight ho for learning, brother. Give me that knowledge. I yearn for the secrets of the universe, and my thirst must be quenched.

Alright, anyways, sort of got off track, but isn't that part of the journey? (I don't know a lot about trains)

SECTION 2: PROJECT STEPS (FOR THE READER AND ME)
As I'm writing this, these are the planned steps for my project. Of course, I have just begun the labor-intensive part, so we shall see how accurate this is a month or so from now.

1. Build a web scraping software that is capable of obtaining many (start with 500), sutras from a website which indexes/has text of lots of sutras.
2. Clean the data so that it is ONLY the sutras. I don't want the chatbot to be confused by unecessary language like headers and footnotes that I forgot to clean from the scraped data.
3. Build a simple AI chatbot, with complexity similar to GPT-2 or BERT.
4. Train the chatbot using the sutras, and interpersonal/spiritual questions in reference to the sutras.
5. Build a simple webpage to host BuddhaChat.

And then I will be done. I already did the first two steps, as of writing this, but I have done them wrong, which is why I made this repo, because I want to track the progress/versions, and am about to start doing them right.
